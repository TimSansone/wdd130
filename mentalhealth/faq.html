                <p>If you or a loved one have a drug or alcohol addiction, treatment can help. While inpatient 
                    drug rehab programs are some of the most effective treatment options for substance use disorders, 
                    many other substance abuse treatment programs exist.</p>
                <p>With so many options available, the process of finding the right treatment center and recovery program 
                    for you or your close family member may seem daunting.</p>

                    and more to ease the search process.</p>

                <h3>General Rehab Questions</h3>
                <p></p>
                <h4>Can I smoke while at rehab?</h4>
                <p></p>
                <p>Smoking is an addiction separate from drug or alcohol abuse, yet it's allowed in many rehab centers.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h4>Can I still work while in rehab?</h4>
                <p></p>
                <p>Though some rehab centers allow you to work during addiction treatment, many require people to be fully immersed in their program.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h4>Can rehab help with depression?</h4>
                <p></p>
                <p>Many people with a substance use disorder also have a co-occurring mental health disorder, such as depression.</p>
                <p>For this reason, rehab centers often structure their treatment programs to address all aspects of a person's health.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h4>Are there lockdowns at rehab centers, where you can't leave?</h4>
                <p></p>
                <p>Different rehab centers will vary on family visitation and facility outing restrictions.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h4>Can I get a private room?</h4>
                <p></p>
                <p>Those seeking addiction treatment may desire a private room so that they can have their own space and maintain a sense of normalcy 
                    and privacy. Some rehab centers offer private rooms at an additional cost while luxury rehab centers may provide private rooms as 
                    a standard.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h4>Do rehab centers allow cell phones?</h4>
                <p></p>
                <p>Some rehab centers often allow phones with certain restrictions. Benefits include staying in touch with loved ones, while disadvantages 
                    include triggers and emotional distress from phone use.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h4>How do substance abuse treatment center loans work?</h4>
                <p></p>
                <p>Treatment center loans offer private financing custom-designed for people with addiction and their families.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h4>Does medicaid cover the cost of suboxone treatment?</h4>
                <p></p>
                <p>Medicaid may cover the cost of Suboxone, though insurance coverage for Suboxone treatment may vary by the state you live in and its 
                    Medicaid program.</p>
                <p></p>
