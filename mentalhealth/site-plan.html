      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Did you know that an average of 265 Americans die each day from a drug overdose? What if I told you that nearly 90 percent of people who need drug rehab do not receive it? There are too many people dying from a disease that can be cured through effective treatment. Most drug addicts do not get effective drug treatment, because it is either too expensive or they just don’t know where to start to seek help. Hi, my name is Tim Sansone, and I’m trying to bring awareness to the problem of drug addiction, especially among adolescent youth, in the United States and the options that are available for those that are seeking help. My website will list rehab centers around the United States and Canada, along with comparing insurance coverage options and likely out-of-pocket expenses to consider. It’s time to bring transparency to drug treatment facilities, so the American public can be better informed, when deciding which form of rehabilitation makes sense for themselves and their loved ones. It’s time to start making an impact on the drug abuse crisis in this country.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>People that are looking for more information about how effective drug rehabilitation programs can be. This website will also compare different types of drug treatment programs and their associated costs.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of my website is to easily identify various drug rehabilitation facilities around the United States and Canada. Not only will I provide links to these sites, but in addition, my website will have real-life testimonials from people/loved ones that have received care from these treatment centers. I will also try to have out-of-pocket expense scenarios for each facility, so people will have a better understanding of how much money they should expect to spend for various treatment options. By providing this information, I hope people can become better informed (and maybe even better motivated to receive treatment) regarding this very difficult time in their life.
      </p>
      <p>
        My website will have various links and items for them to explore. I would like to have an FAQ page, which will have frequently asked questions for people that might need help in just getting started with the process. I will have statistical information about various rehab facilities in the U.S. and Canada, so people can determine what options are best for them. I will have maps, showing where various treatment centers are located, as well as overviews of the facilities, to reassure people as to whether they will feel at home when making their final decision as to what center they choose. By also having positive messages spread out around my website, my hope is to inspire change in individuals. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My website will also have links to trained agents that they can chat with anonymously, if that is an option they would like to have. I will also have visual aids, showing which facilities accept certain types of insurance. This will help determine if certain facilities will be covered by their insurance. The chart will also show the various treatment options that are provided at each facility.  
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a lot of research that will need to be done to complete my website. First off, I am not sure what information is readily available for these treatment facilities already. I know that my wife and I have previously done quite a bit of research, when we were considering entering our son into a treatment facility several years ago. Since then, I realize that there are probably many more options available to provide helpful research for those in need. I will also need to dig into the various types of health insurance and find out how coverage works at drug treatment facilities. I will also need to get addresses and locations of all rehab locations in the U.S. and Canada, so I can provide maps, which will provide a visual guide as to where these facilities are located. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When my wife and I were researching possible facilities to send our son to for help, we ran into a lot of barriers. There was very little information about treatment facilities online. Most of the facilities had a phone number that you could call for more information, but there are a lot of people who may not want to talk to someone, prior to conducting their research. A helpful website, especially when deciding where to send an adolescent, would have benefited us tremendously. I hope that my website will be very user-friendly and I hope to make it extremely easy to compare various treatment options. By having testimonials from people who have successfully completed drug rehab programs, I hope to provide hope for someone who may be on the fence regarding the decision to get help with their substance abuse program (high degree of success), as opposed to trying to do it alone (lower degree of success). This is an extremely difficult decision for people and their loved ones to make. I hope that my website will provide easy to understand options for those looking to make a positive change in their life.
