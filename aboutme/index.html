    <h2>Timothy Sansone</h2>
    <h2>"Tim"</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Timothy Sansone, but everyone calls me Tim. I live in Saint Cloud, Florida.
    I am currently a sophomore at BYU-Idaho and I am pursuing a degree in Applied Technology.</p>
    <p>I have been married to most amazing woman for 22 years and we have 3 beautiful children.
    Matthew (age 18), Kelly (age 16), and Sophia (age 8). We lost our oldest son several years ago, due to a 
    drug overdose. He passed away 9 years ago at the age of 17 and I still miss him every day.</p>
    <p>Some things that I enjoy doing are traveling, going to the beach, watching sports (especially soccer and baseball),
    playing Mario Kart on the Nintendo Switch with my family, and cooking.</p>
    <p>I went through the Pathways Program a few years ago, mainly because I wanted to see if school was something
    that I could still accomplish. However, in the summer of 2020, I was laid off during the pandemic, after 
    working as a manager at Walt Disney World for over 29 years. I was unemployed for nearly 8 months.</p> 
    <p>After many months of diligent prayer and patience, I received a full-time job with the church at the 
    Orlando Florida Temple. I have worked there for 10 months now.</p>
    <p>The thing I love the most about BYU-Idaho, is that they rely heavily on students helping each other succeed. 
    I believe that is something that was missing in my previous educational pursuits.</p>
    <p>I am hoping to continue on to receive my Bachelor Degree in Applied Technology. One of the advantages I see
    from learning about a degree in Web Design, is that I am still not sure which direction I want to go in choosing
    a career to pursue after graduating. Web Design is something that I have been very interested in for a long full-time
    and I know several people that have careers in the Web Design field and they say they love it.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for 23 years. My wife (who I was dating)
    at the time, introduced me to the church. I went through the discussions and decided to be baptised and it is one
    of the best decisions I have ever made. The church has truly been a blessing in my family's life and I don't believe
    my marriage would have survived the death of my son, if it wasn't for having the gospel in my life.</p>
    <p>My favorite quote from Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "Wherever you are, whatever your circumstances may be, you are not
    forgotten. No matter how dark your days may seem, no matter how insignificant you may feel, no matter how overshadowed
    you think you may be, your Heavenly Father has not forgotten you. In fact, He loves you with an infinite love."</p>
    <p>My favorite scripture is "He that is faithful and endureth shall overcome the world" (Doctrine and Covenants 63:47)</p>
